/**
 * This module provides a function to chunk text into smaller pieces suitable for embedding generation. It ensures that the chunks are of manageable size and do not exceed the limits of the embedding model.
 * The chunking process is crucial for handling long job descriptions and ensuring that the embedding model can effectively capture the relevant information without being overwhelmed by too much text at once.
 * The function takes a cleaned job description and splits it into chunks of a specified maximum size, while also ensuring that the chunks are coherent and do not break in the middle of sentences or important information.
 * This allows for better embedding generation and more accurate search results when users query the system.
